# BFS #

  --> it's works like a level order traversel in tree. 
  
  --> we use **queue** for storing next vertex to traverse and **array** (of size -> no.of vertex) for checking whether the node is visited or not
  
  --> if you are trying adj list to perform BFS operation it works based on the insertion not based on left or right side moving 
      
   bcoz we have linked lost not tree

   then apply your concept on your way:
