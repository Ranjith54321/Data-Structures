# Graph #

  Graph is a collection of vertices and edges
  
  based on edges it has two type:
    
      1. directed graph
      2. undirected graph 
      
     weighted graph --> edge with it's weight

    Graph Representaion:
    
          1.) Adgecency Matrix  (when graph is dense)
          2.) Adgecency List     (when graph is sparse)
