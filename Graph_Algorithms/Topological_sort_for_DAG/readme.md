# Topological sort:

  ---> Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (**DAG**) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, 
                          vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
     
  ---> Topological Sorting for a graph is **not possible if the graph is not a DAG**.
  
  ---> the normal methods like MST and SSSPA are find source to destination
  
  --->  Topological sort displays  destination to source
  
  ---> It's working algorithm is same as **DFS** we need to add stack only for keep the vertices
