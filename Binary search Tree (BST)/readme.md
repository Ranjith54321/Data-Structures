 for all the below concepts refer **gfg or youtube**:
 
height or width --> no of nodes from root to leaf

level -> no of node from after root to leaf (i.e,  height-1   this is only for under statnding coding is different for both) 

size of the tree -> total no of nodes in the tree

diameter -> leaf to leaf with maximum posible length (see gfg)

here  code searching for only **BST**
