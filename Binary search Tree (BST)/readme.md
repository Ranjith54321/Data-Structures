 for all the below concepts refer **gfg or youtube**:
 
1. height or width --> no of nodes from root to leaf

2. level -> no of node from after root to leaf (i.e,  height-1   this is only for under statnding coding is different for both) 

3. size of the tree -> total no of nodes in the tree

4. diameter -> leaf to leaf with maximum posible length (see gfg)

5. here  code searching for only **BST** 

**diameter of the tree and check balenced bst are based on finding height**
